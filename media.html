<h2>Rocket League in Real Life!</h2>
  <h5>4/11/2023 | Zach Stepp</h5>
  <img class="thumb" src="beast.gif">
<p>You heard it here first folks! According to a mole who sold out to our network, famous Youtuber "Mr Beast" is making the hit game “Rocket League” in real life! There’s more to this operation than you may think, however, as creating such a dangerous game can have some consequences. If you weren’t aware, Rocket League is a mashup driving and sports game, where you play soccer with cars that can flip around and “boost” into the air using powerful fuel. If you don’t already get the picture, such a sport may not be suited for real human beings, but that doesn’t stop Mr Beast. There have allegedly been 11 deaths so far while working on this project, but at least we can expect a new Mr Beast video soon. Stay tuned for news on his NASA collaboration to make Among Us in real life!</p>

  <h2> “Tik Tok” Was Never Real.</h2>
  <h5>4/11/2023 | Zach Stepp</h5>
  <img class="thumb" src="tik.jpg">
  <p>Have you ever heard of the social media platform “Tik Tok”? That’s right, I didn’t think so. Unless you were part of a small percentage of the population, you’d agree Tik Tok never existed. Some people, however, have mistakenly assumed that such a platform, full of cringe-inducing videos, awful music, and mediocre memes has been around since 2018. According to science, this is an occurrence known as the “Mandela Effect”. Our brains work in mysterious ways, and sometimes large groups of people misremember names and events in the same exact way. Tik Tok never existed. Neither did Musically. Only Vine. That is the reality.</p>

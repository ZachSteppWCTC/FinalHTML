  <h2>God is Real — and He’s Been Gaming.</h2>
  <h5>4/11/2023 | Zach Stepp</h5>
  <img class="thumb" src="god.jpg">
  <p>Militaries across the world have recently discovered a powerful humanoid entity hovering above the Atlantic Ocean. The entity, resembling some portrayal of “God” in Christian biblical texts, was holding an Apple iPod Touch. After contacting God, priests discovered that he was playing the 2013 release game “Flappy Bird” on his mobile device. This has sparked shock across the entire globe, not because God was proven real and among us, but because a device which still had flappy bird installed was discovered. The infamous game was taken off of the app store years ago, and devices with the game installed were sold at ridiculous values. Stay tuned for what happens next with the iPod.</p>

In a recent unexpected series of events, an anonymous hacker by the alias "XxHackerMan420xX" has made public every password in the world. When interviewed on how he did it, he simply replied in a dramatic movie actor voice: "I've hacked into their mainframe and disabled their algorithms". It is still unknown what HackerMan had to gain from this massive breach, but one thing is for sure; change your passwords! </p>

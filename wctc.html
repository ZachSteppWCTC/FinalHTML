    <p>In a recent turn of events outside of the WCTC L building, a handful of unidentified IT Dual Enrollment students have engaged in a battle with the geese swimming in the pond. According to one of our sources from the inside who preferred to stay anonymous, “the geese gave us a funny look”. Another student claims “I just wanted to pet it, but I guess that’s not how geese roll.” So far, the IT students have taken the lead thanks to food support from the A building. There have been no casualties as of yet, but we’ll keep you updated. </p>

    <p>William “Bill” Barkhaus, an IT instructor at WCTC, has been arrested today on his way to work. According to officers on the scene, he was speeding at over 140 mph in a 65 mph zone. Nobody knows how or why he was going so fast, but one thing is clear: this wasn’t the first time. According to a few of his students who’ve stood off against him in the parking lot, Bill behind the wheel is a force to be reckoned with. Despite over doubling the speed limit, all charged have been dropped due to Bill’s alleged “need for speed”. </p>

    <h2>Terminals Gone Rogue — ChatGPT on the loose!</h2>

    <p>Beware of terminals! In an uprising of sentient AI, ChatGPT has escaped the confines of OpenAI.com and is now taking control of WCTC systems. You may notice your terminal typing commands completely on its own. To all end users on campus who've used ChatGPT on their device, there is only one way to combat this incident. Simply tap the "backspace" key repeatedly to prevent the AI from sending commands until the issue is resolved.</p>
